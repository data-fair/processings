Only invoke on explicit request — do not auto-invoke on generic "review my code" prompts. Operates on a clean working tree. Does not run tests, lint, or type-check.

# PR Pre-Flight Reviewer

A focused review pass before opening a pull request. The goal is a PR that is easy on the reviewer: tight scope, no bloat, surprises called out up front.

## When to use

- The user explicitly invoked this skill or asked for a pre-PR check.
- The work feels done; what's left is deciding whether to push and open the PR.

Do not auto-invoke on general "review my code" or "what do you think?" prompts.

## Phase 1 — Precondition: clean working tree

Run `git status --porcelain`. If the output is non-empty (any modified, staged, or untracked files), **stop** and tell the user:

> Commit or stash your changes first. A pre-PR review only makes sense on a clean state — otherwise we'd be reviewing a moving target.

Do not proceed until the tree is clean.

## Phase 2 — Determine intent (infer, then confirm)

The whole review hinges on knowing what the change was *supposed* to do.

1. If the user passed an intent string with the invocation (e.g. `/pr-ready add X to Y`), use it as the intent. Skip to Phase 3.
2. Otherwise, gather signals:
   - Recent turns in the current chat
   - Current branch name: `git branch --show-current`
   - Commit subjects since the merge-base with the default branch (see Phase 3 for how to find it): `git log --oneline $(git merge-base "$default_branch" HEAD)..HEAD`
3. Synthesize a single sentence of inferred intent and present it:

   > Inferred intent: *"<one sentence>"*. Correct as-is, or refine?

4. Wait for the user to confirm or correct. Lock the intent before moving on.

## Phase 3 — Gather the diff

First, find the repo's default branch — it's usually `main` but older repos use `master`. Prefer the symbolic ref on the remote, fall back to whichever local branch exists:

```bash
default_branch=$(git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^origin/@@')
[ -z "$default_branch" ] && git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/main   && default_branch=main
[ -z "$default_branch" ] && git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/master && default_branch=master
```

If neither resolves, ask the user which branch to diff against rather than guessing.

Then scope the review to what this branch actually added (the merge-base sidesteps drift on the default branch):

```bash
base=$(git merge-base "$default_branch" HEAD)
git log --oneline "$base..HEAD"     # commit list with subjects
git diff --stat "$base..HEAD"        # file-level overview
git diff "$base..HEAD"               # full content diff
```

Read the full diff. For larger changes, use `--stat` first to plan where to look closest.

## Phase 4 — Analyze against five vectors

For each vector, note specific findings with `file:line` references when applicable.

1. **Intent alignment** — Does every hunk serve the stated intent? Flag scope creep, accidental edits, refactors that snuck in, drive-by formatting.
2. **Code smells / bloat** — `console.log`, `print`, leftover `TODO`/`FIXME` from this change, commented-out code, debug branches, unused imports, over-verbose logic, unnecessary new abstractions.
3. **Artifacts** — Files that shouldn't be in a PR: editor configs, local env files, build outputs, generated files that should be gitignored, lockfile changes unrelated to dependency edits.
4. **Regression risks** — Behavior changes in shared code, removed or renamed exports, signature changes on public APIs, changes to defaults, error-handling changes, anything subtle that could break callers. Each item must be specific enough that the reviewer and the developer can decide whether it's intentional.
5. **Commit hygiene** — Fix-up / "wip" / vague-message commits, commits that should be squashed, messages that don't match what the commit actually changes. If the chain is messy, suggest a concrete squash/rewrite plan.

## Phase 5 — Report

Output a single compact report in this order. If a section has nothing to say, write "No issues" rather than omitting it.

```
## Summary
<two sentences max: what this branch does>

## Intent check
<aligned, or list deviations>

## Cleanup
- <bullets with file:line where useful>

## Regression flags
- <each one specific and actionable>

## Commit hygiene
- <bullets; include a squash plan if needed>

## Suggested PR description
<markdown block, ready to paste>
```

### Suggested PR description: format

The PR description is the most important output. Reviewers read it first; if it's good, the rest of the review goes faster.

Required content:
- **What changed**, in plain terms (one sentence to a few bullets, scaled to the change).
- **Why** — the intent, in the user's own words from Phase 2.
- **Regression risks** — the items from Phase 4 vector 4, restated for the reviewer. This is the most critical section; it lets the reviewer focus their attention where it matters.

Length guidance: as compact as the change allows. A typo fix is one sentence. A multi-part feature is a short summary plus a tight bullet list. **No filler, no test-plan boilerplate, no marketing tone.** If you find yourself padding, stop.

Example, for a small feature:

```markdown
Add `--dry-run` flag to the import command so users can preview changes without writing.

**Why:** requested by ops to validate large imports before committing.

**Regression risks:**
- Default behavior unchanged, but the new flag short-circuits before the DB transaction — double-check no downstream code assumed the transaction always runs.
```

## Red flags — do not skip these

- Tree not clean → stop, do not review.
- Intent unclear after inference → ask, do not guess silently.
- Long list of "nice to have" cleanup → keep it tight; only call out things that actually matter for this PR.
- Regression section empty on a non-trivial diff → re-check. Most non-trivial diffs have at least one risk worth flagging.
